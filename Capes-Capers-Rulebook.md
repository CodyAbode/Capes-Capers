# Overview
**Capes & Capers** (C&C) is a Tabletop Role-playing Game (TTRPG) for telling stories featuring superpowered heroes, villains, and rogues!

You play a superpowered character aligned with your fellow player's characters as a part of a Super Team. The game is played in two repeating phases: Downtime, and Missions.

# Downtime
During downtime, you take turns rolling on specific tracks. You may roll on any number of tracks you would like, but every roll must pass a higher threshold. Performing well on a track imparts benefits, but performing poorly or neglecting a track has consequences. Time passes during downtime however best fits the narrative, but it is typically a few days. Tracks do not necessarily have to be rolled chronologically.

When you enter downtime, you recover all resources spent during missions such as HP and PP.

## Tracks
There are six Tracks; Investigation, Occupation, Relationships, Rest, Training, and Welfare. Each track has an attribute associated with it, but your GM may call for a different attribute depending on the situation. Generally, you may only roll on each track once per Downtime phase.

## Investigation
Your team may not know all the details pertaining to your next mission. Performing well may reveal information, or even provide you a benefit during the next mission. This track is typically rolled with INT.

## Occupation
Performing well may provide a benefit related to your occupation and situation. For example, doing well as a reporter may provide Advantage on your next Investigation roll. Repeated neglect or poor performance may cause you Stress, the loss of your job, or may even blow your cover. Roll an attribute associated with your occupation, such as WIL if you are a reporter, or INT if you are a student.

## Relationships
This track functions similarly to the Occupation track, but has to do with maintaining your relationships with friends, family, or significant others. This track is typically rolled with WIL.

## Rest
Rest and relaxation is the best way to deal with stress. Resting well removes a Stress point, very well removes 2, and extremely well removes 3. Poor rest does not have any consequences, but building up Stress can. This track is typically rolled with END.

## Training
Superpowers need to be honed to be as effective as possible. Performing well provides you a Training Die (TD), while performing extremely well provides 2. This track is rolled with an attribute associated with one of your power sets.

## Welfare
This track concerns minor heroics such as getting a cat down from a tree or following up on the citizen you saved from a burning building. Performing well can earn you fame, which may earn you the help of new allies. Performing poorly may cause some to refuse to help you. This track is rolled with an attribute associated with one of your power sets.

## Roll Threshold
The threshold for the first track is 5 and increases by 5 for each additional track. Meeting the threshold is considered performing well on a track. Beating the threshold by 5 is considered very well, and beating it by 10 is considered extremely well. Similar considerations are made when performing poorly.

| Result | Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 | Round 5 | Round 6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extremely Poor | -10 | -5 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| Very Poor | -5 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |
| Poor | 0 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| Well | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |
| Very Well | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 |
| Extremely Well | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 |

## Stress
If you do not reach your desired roll when rolling on a track, you can take a Stress point to roll again and take the higher roll. You may do this multiple times in a row for the same track.

If your Stress points exceed 3, you take on increasingly worse effects as indicated on the table below.

| Stress Level | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 0-3  | No effect |
| 4  | Your PP maximum is reduced by your stress points |
| 5  | Your attributes are reduced by your stress points when resisting |
| 6  | Your attributes are reduced by your stress points |
| 7+  | Your HP maximum is reduced by half |

## Using your powers
You may use your powers during downtime. You are not restricted to your specific powers during this phase. For example, you could use your Electricity Control power set to hot-wire a car. Furthermore, you do not need to spend PP to do so.

## Collaboration
During a downtime round, you may collaborate with other members of your Super Team on a track. When you do so, roll individually as normal, but you use sum of your modifiers for the roll. Additionally, you may take Stress points to assist the other members involved.

# Missions
During a mission you are attempting to accomplish a task. You may act freely until your Game Master calls for you to enter initiative. During initiative, you, your team members, non-player characters (NPCs), and events take turns acting.

To enter initiative, roll a d20, and add your AGI. Use your Agility to resolve ties. This determines the turn order.

At the start of your turn, you get an Action, Quick Action, Reaction and Movement. You can use your reaction after turn, but cannot use it again until the start of your next turn.

## Power Multiplier
Powers that have a cost marked with a "*" allow you to spend additional Power Points to make the power stronger. This is done prior to your power roll. The Power Multiplier (PM) is equal to how many times you paid the cost of the power. Power points must be spent in multiples of the cost. The PM cannot be less than 1 nor greater than your power Level.

For example, if you are at PL3 and have a power with a power point cost of "2*", you can spend 2, 4, or 6 PP for a PM of 1, 2, or 3.

## Power Rolls
Using a power that targets enemies usually requires a Power Roll. These are performed by rolling a d20 and adding the modifier of the attribute associated with the power. The target of the power may resist the power using their attribute values. You must meet or beat their resistance in order for your power to affect them.

Powers that deal damage are resisted based on the type of damage they deal, as listed below. Otherwise, the power will state which attribute(s) can be used for Resisting.

- Physical (PHS) can be resisted with AGI or END.
- Energy (ENR) can be resisted with AGI or WIL.
- Mental (MNT) can be resisted with INT or WIL.

Powers that target multiple characters only require one power roll, but the targeted characters resist individually.

### Advantages and Penalties
Advantage Dice and Penalty Dice are rolled in addition to a normal d20 roll and you keep the highest or lowest roll among all the dice rolled. These can be stacked and cancel each other out equally.

Training Dice can be expended to get an Advantage Die on a Power Roll or to increase a Power Modifier by 1. Multiple TD can be expended on a single power. These are gained by training during Downtime, but may also be awarded by your GM.

### Additional Effects
When you make a power roll, if you beat the resistance of an affected character by 5, it may have an additional effect, depending on the power. If you roll a 20 on your d20 while making a power roll, the power can not be resisted, additional effects are applied, and the power multiplier is doubled, if applicable.

## Team Maneuvers
During your turn, you may agree upon a Team Maneuver which require Actions, Quick Actions, and/or Reactions from other members of your Super Team. These actions are used regardless of whether the maneuver succeeds or fails. As Actions and Quick Actions can only be used during your turn, a maneuver may take more than one turn to complete.

### Tee Up
This maneuver requires you to have and use a power that can knock an enemy into a team member. That team member must spend their reaction. If successful, that team member may immediately use any appropriate power they have that would otherwise take a Action, Quick Actions, or Reaction, against that enemy.

### Fastball Special
This maneuver requires you to be adjacent to a team member. You use your action to attempt throw the team member, who must use their reaction. Make a MIG roll, the threshold to meet is the inverse of their Agility ((20 - Agility)). If successful, that team member may immediately use any appropriate power they have that would otherwise take a Action, Quick Actions, or Reaction, against that enemy.

## Knocked Around
Knocking a character causes them to move in a specified direction, including up or down. Characters that are knocked up take applicable falling damage. Characters that are knock into or through a wall or ceiling take an extra 1d6 damage. If they are knocked into another character, both characters take 1d6 damage.

Falling characters take 1d6 PHS damage for at the end of the fall for every 2 units fallen.

## Status Effects
- **Blind:** Unless you have Super Sense, you suffer a Penalty Die when making Power Rolls targeting other characters., and other characters gain an advantage die for attacks targeting you.
- **Burning:** At the end of your turn, you take 1d4 ENR damage. You or another adjacent character can end this effect as an action.
- **Bleeding:** At the start of your turn, you take 1d4 PHS damage. This effect ends when you receive any healing.
- **Grappled:** You are immobilized and are moved along with the character grappling you. As an action, you can attempt to escape by making a MIG or AGI roll that the grappling character can resist with Might.
- **Immobilized:** Your speed is 0. If you are knocked down, you can not get back up.
- **Knocked Down:** You are slowed. You can end this effect as a quick action, but do not regain your lost movement.
- **Slowed:** Your speed is reduced by half.
- **Stunned:** You are unable to act.
- **Unconscious:** You are unable to act. This effect ends if you gain more than 0 HP.

# Player Characters
Characters are created by coming up with identities, then selecting attributes, an origin, and power sets. See the following Powers section when you're ready to select your powers.

## Identities
Your character will have separate mundane and superpowered identities. These connection of these identities are a closely guarded secret, in order to protect their family, friends, and themselves. Consider these details, including their Code Name, Real Name, either now or while you continue creating the rest of your character.

### Occupation
An important part of your character's identity is their day job. These help them to maintain a cover, but can also provide resources, leads, and allies to assist with their superpowered work. Ask your Game Master about what occupations would be available to your character. Examples include reporter, private investigator, student, and scientist.

## Attributes
Attributes are a representation of character's physical and mental abilities. Attribute modifiers are added to relevant rolls at the discretion of the Game Master.

**Might (MIG)** measures physical strength.  
**Agility (AGI)** measures physical reflexes and deftness.  
**Endurance (END)** measures stamina and fortitude.  
**Intellect (INT)** measures intelligence and intuition.  
**Will (WIL)** measures resolve.  

When creating a character, use the following array to set their attribute values: 14, 13, 12, 11, 10.

When text uses the full name of an ability, such as "Might", it is referring to the value of the attribute (e.g. 14). When the shorthand, such as "MIG" is used, it is referring to the modifier (e.g. 2). The modifier is calculated by subtracting 10 from the attribute value and then dividing the total by 2, while rounding down.

| Value | Modifier | Value | Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | 0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

**Hit Points (HP)** are a measure of your current fortitude. Your hit point maximum starts equal to your Endurance. Every time you gain a level, increase it by half your Endurance (rounded up).

When your HP hits 0, you become unconscious and suffer a stress point. If your HP goes below the negative value of your HP maximum, you die.

**Power Points (PP)** are a measure of your current stamina, and are spent on powers. Your Power Point maximum starts equal to your Endurance. Every time you gain a level, increase it by your END.

When your PP hits 0, any powers you have active end. If it is the first time this has happened during a mission, you suffer a stress point.

**Speed** is a measurement of how far in Units you can move per turn. It is equal to 5 plus your character's AGI.

**Stress** is an indicator of the pressure your character is experiencing. It is explained further in the Downtime section. It starts at 0.

**Power Level** is your current level, it starts at 1 and increases when decided by your Game Master, up to 12.

## Origin
Origins are the source of your character's powers. They may have an effect on how others perceive you. You may be able to get advantage on rolls for things relating to your origin, such as hot-wiring a car with the Technology background.

### Mythic
Your powers come from the fact that you are a creature or person of legend. You may be the kin or champion of a deity, or even a deity yourself. You may be exalted by some and condemned by others for your status.

Attribute bonus: +2 Might

### Natural
You aren't 'super'; your amazing talents come from intense training and innate abilities. You might have been driven to physical excellence by some all-encompassing desire for perfection or revenge, or perhaps you are not human at all, and possess powers natural to your race.

Attribute bonus: +2 Agility

### Mutation
You received your powers during birth, experimentation or a scientific accident, differing you from the rest of your kind. Mutants are often viewed with awe and fear by those who don't understand them.

Attribute bonus: +2 Endurance

### Technology
You derive your powers from technological devices, from suits of high-tech body armor to powerful energy weapons. You may have acquired this technology through your or another's brilliance, or perhaps even from the future.

Attribute bonus: +2 Intellect

### Magic
You receive your powers from a magical source. These abilities might come from a mystical artifact bestowed upon you, the mastery of numerous magical spells, or pacts made with powerful dimensional entities.

Attribute bonus: +2 Will
